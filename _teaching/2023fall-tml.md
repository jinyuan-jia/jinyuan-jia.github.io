## Overview
Machine learning techniques are widely used to solve real-world problems. However, a key challenge is that they are vulnerable to various security and privacy attacks, e.g., adversarial examples, data poisoning attacks, and membership inference attacks. In this course, we will discuss existing attacks and state-of-the-art defenses against those attacks.
