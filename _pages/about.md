Welcome to Jinyuan Jia's homepage!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at [Duke University](https://duke.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/). In prior, I received the M.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from [Iowa State University](https://iastate.edu) in 2019. I got my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn) in 2016. My research interest lies in the intersections between security, privacy, and machine learning.
