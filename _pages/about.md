Welcome to Jinyuan Jia's homepage!

I am an Assistant Professor of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on building provably robust and privacy-preserving machine learning systems. 

Previously, I was a postdoc at the University
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of [Prof. Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). I received a B.E. from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn) in 2016, a M.E. from [Iowa State University](https://iastate.edu) in 2019, and a Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at [Duke University](https://duke.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) in 2022.
