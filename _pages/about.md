Welcome to Jinyuan Jia's homepage!

<span style="color:red">I will join the College of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University as an assistant professor in July 2023!
</span>

I am a postdoc at the University
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of [Prof. Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). I received a B.E. from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn) in 2016, a M.E. from [Iowa State University](https://iastate.edu) in 2019, and a Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at [Duke University](https://duke.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) in 2022.

I am broadly interested in security, privacy, and machine learning with a recent focus on the intersections among them.

<span style="color:red"> **Openings:** I am looking for PhD students and interns to join our research group.  Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me! </span>
